### Develop

If you wish to develop on this project, make sure to install the development
dependencies. But first, [create a virtual environment][venv] and then install
those dependencies.

[venv]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/install/#create-a-virtual-environment

```console
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements.txt
```

Then, point your environment to this directory:

```console
$ pip install -e .
```

Now, you can edit the files and they will be automatically be seen by your
environment, even when running from the `chaos` command locally.
